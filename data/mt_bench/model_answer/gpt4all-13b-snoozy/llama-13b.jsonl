The work is epic in scale and is regarded as one of the most important works of world literature. It is considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, along with his other major prose work Anna Karenina (1877).\nThe novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.\nTolstoy said that War and Peace was \"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle\". Large sections, especially the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.\nThe novel is divided into four volumes, each volume containing several books. The first volume opens with the old Prince Bolkonsky's birthday party at his country estate. The guests include the Rostovs, the Bagrations, and the Kuragins. The novel's main characters are introduced: Pierre, Prince Andrei, and Natasha Rostov; Prince Andrei's sister, Princess Marya; and Boris, the eldest son of the old Prince Bolkonsky.\nThe second volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' preparations for the coming war. Pierre, who has been called to join the army, is sent to the front lines. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are separated by the war.\nThe third volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' reunion in Moscow. Pierre is taken prisoner by the French. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are reunited in Moscow.\nThe fourth volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' reunion in Moscow. Pierre is taken prisoner by the French. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are reunited in Moscow.\n2. History:\nThe history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States, a country in North America.
