As a speaker, you'll have the chance to hone your communication skills, build confidence in speaking, and share your knowledge with the attendees. \n\nIt might be intimidating at first, but I'm sure you can do it. You have a lot of valuable insights to share, and you'll be surprised by how much you enjoy it. Plus, it's only for one event, so there's no pressure to do it again if you don't want to. \n\nIf you're still hesitant, consider this: volunteering as a speaker will help you to get comfortable with public speaking and could even lead to more speaking opportunities in the future.

It is often expressed as a percentage or decimal fraction. For example, if you flip a coin, the probability of getting a heads side up is 50%. To understand how probability works, it's important to understand the different types of probability. There are two main types of probability: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive probability is used to describe the likelihood of a specific event occurring, while inferential probability is used to estimate the probability of a certain event based on past data. For example, you can use inferential probability to estimate the probability of rain based on the amount of rain that has already fallen in a certain area.
