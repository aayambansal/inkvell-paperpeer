The event will be held at [Location] on [Date] from [Time] to [Time].\nAs you may know, [Event Name] is an annual fundraising event that raises awareness and funds for [Cause]. It celebrates the contributions of local artists and showcases their work in an art gallery. The event also features a number of talks by guest speakers on various topics related to [Cause].\nI think you would be an ideal guest speaker for this event because you're an [Occupation] and have a wealth of knowledge and experience in [Cause]. You have a passion for making a difference in [Cause], and your stories and insights would be inspiring to the audience.\nI know you're an introvert and dislike public speaking, but I'm convinced that you would do a great job. I can help you prepare for the event by sharing a few tips and tricks that will make you more comfortable and confident on stage.\nI'm sure you'll have a great time at the event and meet lots of interesting people.\nIf you're not free on [Date] and [Time], perhaps you could still volunteer as a guest speaker at another time.\nI look forward to hearing from you and hope to see you at the event.\nChamath Palihapitiya, an investor in Facebook and Airbnb, said in a keynote at Stanford: \"The probability that you'll change the world is inversely proportional to how well you know what you are doing.\"\nIn other words, the more you know about a specific topic, the less likely you are to be successful.\nAnother quote from Chamath: \"When you get the chance to do something, say yes.\"\nIt\u2019s important to say yes to new opportunities, even if they make you uncomfortable. This is especially true for introverts, who are often reluctant to embrace new experiences.\nIt\u2019s easy to say no because it\u2019s safe and comfortable. But if you want to have a fulfilling life, you must step out of your comfort zone and try new things.\nThe best way to overcome your introverted tendencies is to get out of your head and stop thinking about the consequences. When you\u2019re in your head, worrying about what could go wrong, you\u2019re not living in the present and enjoying the experience.\nInstead, try to focus on the here and now. Remind yourself that the experience is happening now, not in the future.
