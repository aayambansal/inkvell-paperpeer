However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.\n- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options.
