Science and technology: Probability math is used in science and technology to make decisions and to figure out the likelihood of something happening. Probability math is also used to figure out the likelihood of a particle behaving a certain way.\n5. Finance: Probability math is used in finance to figure out the likelihood of a stock going up or down. Probability math is also used to figure out the likelihood of you winning or losing at the casino.\n6. Medicine: Probability math is used by medical professionals to determine different outcomes of a disease and the likelihood of a patient dying from a disease.\nRemember, probability is the study of the likelihood of future events. It is a quantitative measure of how likely an event is to occur. In probability, the possible outcomes of a given event are called sample spaces, and each outcome has a probability. The ratio can be expressed in words as \"the chance of X happening.\"", "Riemannian geometry is a broad area of mathematics that focuses on curvature. It's different from Euclidean geometry because it measures the curvature of a surface, rather than its distance from a point.\nAn example of a surface is the Earth. The Earth is curved, so it has a curvature. Euclidean geometry measures the distance from a point, like the distance from your house to the store.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the angle of a triangle is 180 degrees, but in Riemannian geometry, the angle of a triangle can be more or less than 180 degrees.\nRemember, Riemannian geometry is a broad area of mathematics that focuses on curvature.

It is a quantitative measure of how likely an event is to occur.

The ratio can be expressed in words as \"the chance of X happening.\"\nProbability math can be used in a variety of fields like finance, medicine, engineering, and technology.\nHere are some examples of using probability in everyday life:\n1. Using a coin flip to decide something: You can use probability math to decide if you should flip a coin to decide if your team wins or loses a game. You can decide what the win/loss is and then figure out the probability of that happening.\n2.

Antitrust laws are designed to encourage the growth of free markets by preventing anti-competitive behavior such as price fixing, collusion over market shares, and predatory behavior.\nIn the US, antitrust laws are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The FTC is responsible for enforcing antitrust laws in the consumer market, while the DOJ enforces antitrust laws in the business market.\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 is the first federal antitrust law in the US.

The AML prohibits monopolistic agreements, abuse of dominant market position, and mergers and acquisitions that would substantially lessen competition. The AML also prohibits the abuse of intellectual property rights to eliminate or restrict competition.\nThe AML is enforced by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The SAMR is responsible for enforcing the AML in the consumer market, while the MOFCOM enforces the AML in the business market.\nThe AML is similar to the Sherman Antitrust Act in that it prohibits monopolization, price fixing, and collusion over market shares.
