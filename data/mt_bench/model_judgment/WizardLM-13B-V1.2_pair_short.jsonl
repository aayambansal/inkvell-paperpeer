The calculation can be derived from the total percentage of students that like either color (58% + 45% = 103%) and then subtracting the percentage of students who like both colors (22%). This results in 103% - 22% = 81%, which is the sum of the percentage of students who like blue (58%) and green (45%). To calculate the probability that a student does not like either color, we divide the percentage that like only one color (58% + 45% - 22% = 71%) by the total percentage of students (100%). This gives 71% / 100% = 0.71, or 71%.

The probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 is 35 out of 36. The correct way to think about it is that out of 36 possible outcomes (rolling 2 dice), there are 6 outcomes where the total number is less than 3 (such as 1+1, 1+2, etc.). Therefore, there are 35 outcomes where the total number is at least 3 (such as 2+2, 2+3, 3+1, etc.). This means the probability is 35/36, or 35/36 as the reference answer suggests.
