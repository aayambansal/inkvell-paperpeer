The   concept   of   probability   is   often   used   in   everyday   life   to   calculate   the   likelihood   of   different   outcomes   occurring.   For   example,   in   the   case   of   rolling   a   die,   the   probability   of   getting   a   number   between   1   and   6   is   1/6.   This   means   that   there   is   a   1/6   chance   of   getting   any   of   these   numbers   when   you   roll   the   die.   To   calculate   the   probability   of   an   event   occurring,   we   use   the   probability   mass   function   (PMF)   of   a   set   of   events.   The   PMF   is   a   function   that   describes   the   distribution   of   the   possible   outcomes   of   an   event,   and   it", "turn": 1, "tstamp": 1705397744.0234988}
