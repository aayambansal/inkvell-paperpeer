Assistant B's response is also informative, providing more explanation and examples, as well as online resources for further study. However, Assistant A's response is simpler and directly answers the question asked. Therefore, I would judge Assistant A's response as the better one.\n\nFor the second request on the differences between Riemannian geometry and Euclidean geometry, both Assistant A and Assistant B's responses are incomplete and lacking in depth. Assistant A's response briefly mentions that Riemannian geometry deals with curved spaces, while Euclidean geometry deals with flat spaces, but fails to provide any further explanation or examples. Similarly, Assistant B's response mentions that Riemannian geometry uses curved spaces and Euclidean geometry uses flat spaces, but does not provide any further details or explanation.
